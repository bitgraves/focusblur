# bitgraves/interfaces

These are graphical interfaces for [bit graves](http://bitgraves.com) live performance and recording.

- `macos/hexagon`: Runs ChucK patches and listens for OSC messages to display the state of the patch.
- `ios/focusblur`: Listens to the device microphone and displays responsive art. Probably broken.
